Every engineer dreams of working with Designers who understand the feasibility and complexity of the technology and devise a design strategy to support the engineering team. Bora was one of the finest Product Designers I&apos;ve ever worked with. He is not only good with design but also understands product requirements and technical challenges to come up with intuitive designs. During my time at FreshBooks, he was my go-to person to discuss complex problems and get insights about creative design thinking. Bora can understand any tech stack and technical challenges very well to come up with tech stack and technical challenges very well to come up with design patterns that are feasible and at par with product expectations. Which, in turn, helps the engineering team implement ideal designs for the product. It was my pleasure to work with Bora, and I highly recommend him. He will be an asset to any engineering team that wants to work with a designer who is well-versed in most modern technological stacks and intuitive design thinking."
